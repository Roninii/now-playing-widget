This was intended to be an API for fetching user's now playing data from Spotify, but after tinkering for a little, it seems like Spotify's API doesn't really support this. This led to a feeling that the solution was likely going to be a hacky workaround where I'm using puppeteer in some way to complete the login flow, using refresh tokens to keep the user logged in.

For now, I'm scrapping this project. Maybe I'll return later!
